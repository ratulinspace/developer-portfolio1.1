            <h4>“They're not that different from you, are they? Same haircuts. Full of hormones, just like you.
                Invincible, just like you feel. The world is their oyster. They believe they're destined for great
                things, just like many of you, their eyes are full of hope, just like you. Did they wait until it was
                too late to make from their lives even one iota of what they were capable? Because, you see gentlemen,
                these boys are now fertilizing daffodils. But if you listen real close, you can hear them whisper their
                legacy to you. Go on, lean in. Listen, you hear it? - - Carpe - - hear it? - - Carpe, carpe diem, seize
                the day boys, make your lives extraordinary.”</h4>
